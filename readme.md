# Custom Auth View and Layout

Here is a custom `views/layout/app.blade.php`, `views/auth/login.blade.php` and `views/auth/register.blade.php` to give the default login and registration view some facelift.

### How To Install
After your scaffold your auth views - replace the default `views/layout/app.blade.php`, `views/auth/login.blade.php` and `views/auth/register.blade.php`  with these files **in this repository**.

Also add `public\images` and `public\css\login.css` from **this repository** to your `public` folder. That's all!


> Tested with Laravel 6x and 7x.
